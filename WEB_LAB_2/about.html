        <h2>FashionX</h2><br>
        <p>Founded in 2023, FashinonX has come a long way from its beginnings as a wholesaler. With a mission to become a globally recognized Indian wear brand by 2025, our 34 year long journey started with revolutionizing daily wear for Indian women. At a time when saris were the only staple choice for women in India, we started designing and manufacturing salwar kameez and churidar. After anticipated resistance, we received love from all the nooks and corners of the country, which led us to designing Tunics and Midi-Dress with an ethnic twist.</p>
        <p>When we first started out, our passion for creating elegant and plush Indian ethnic wear at affordable prices drove us to step into the world of retailing which in turn gave us the impetus to turn this hard work and inspiration into a booming online store. We now supply to more than 350 retail stores worldwide and are proud owners of 4 flagship stores in Mumbai. The year we hit our 25th year, the brand added another feather to its cap by winning an award for ‘The Most Admired Women’s Wear Brand’ at CMAI’s Apex Awards, 2015.</p>
        <p>In the coming years we look forward to reaching out to more people through both online and offline platforms, ensuring unmatched quality and consumer satisfaction. All we hope is that you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. So keep the love coming!</p>
