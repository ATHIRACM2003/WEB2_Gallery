            <h2>Bees</h2>
            <p><dfn>Bees</dfn> are fascinating creatures that play a  crucial role in our ecosystem. 
                <blockquote>"Without bees, our food supply would be drastically reduced,"</blockquote> says entomologist Dr. Jane Smith. 
                These industrious <small>insects</small> are essential pollinators for many of the crops we rely on, 
                including fruits, vegetables, and nuts. 
                "Bees are responsible for pollinating approximately one-third of the food we consume" 
                 bees contribute to the beauty of our environment by aiding in the reproduction of flowering plants.
                  "Their work goes largely unnoticed, but without bees, the landscape of our world would be vastly different," <ins>emphasizes environmental scientist <mark>Dr. John Doe</mark>. </ins>
                  <blockquote><q>Despite their importance, <samp>bee populations</samp> are declining due to factors like habitat loss, 
                  pesticides, and climate change.</q> </blockquote><del>As Emily Brown, a conservation biologist, states,</del>
                   "Protecting bees is essential not just for their survival but for the health of our planet as a whole." To copy these text press <kbd>Ctrl+c</kbd></p>
